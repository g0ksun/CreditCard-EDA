# Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Application on Credit Card Application Dataset

    This is an EDA exercise.

## Objectives

    The analyses implemented with Python aim to understand the factors influencing credit application approvals, predict the probabilities of approval or rejection, and optimize the application process for credit providers while improving risk management.

    1. To explore the impact of demographic factors such as income level, education level, and age on credit card score.
    2. Examining customers' current debt status and payment habits.
    3. Effectively predicting credit card scores with machine learning algorithms and investigating the factors in these predictions.
